## Create a GO-bot in Python

The repository was created to teach the basics of the Python language, object-oriented programming, and algorithms. Some functions and classes are missing ("NotImplemented" / "pass"), and your task is to restore the code. Ultimately, you need to run the non-working project.


The repository was created based on the following projects:
[Deep Learning and the Game of Go](https://github.com/maxpumperla/deep_learning_and_the_game_of_go/tree/master)
[JavaScript GoBoard](https://github.com/jokkebk/jgoboard/tree/master)
These guys are really cool, thank you very much!
